## ConnectionManager
Event Manager Module A lightweight utility for dealing with events efficiently.  

## ðŸŒŸ Features
Add, retrieve, or remove event connections with the following simple methods. Includes methods for removing all connections, or those matching a prefix. Prevents memory leaks by cleaning up unused events.

## ðŸ“– Usage
AddConnection
```lua
:AddConnection(Connection: RBXScriptConnection, Path: string)
```
# Connection: The RBXScriptConnection to store (e.g. from.Connect().).
Path: Connection name. If this is not set, the connection name will be generated randomly.

```lua
:GetConnection(Path: string, nodebug: boolean)
```
# Retrieve a stored connection by its name (Path).

Path: The name of the connection to retrieve.
nodebug: defaults to false. When true, suppresses debug output.

```lua
:GetAllConnections()
```
# Returns a table of all the stored connections.

```lua
:RemoveConnection(Path: string)
```
# Removes and cleans up a connection by its name.

Path: The name of the connection to remove.

```lua
:RemoveAllConnectionsStartsWith(Name: string)
```
# Removes all the connections whose names start with the given string.

# Example:
If the following relationships are named Chicken, Cheese, Hamburger, and Class:
RemoveAllConnectionsStartsWith("C") will clean up Chicken, Cheese, and Class.
RemoveAllConnectionsStartsWith("CH") will clean up Chicken and Cheese.
Note: This is case-sensitive.

```lua
:RemoveAllConnections()
```
# Completely removes and cleans all stored connections.
